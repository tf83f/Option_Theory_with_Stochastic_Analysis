This repository contains my personal notes and exercise solutions for the book **Option Theory with Stochastic Analysis: An Introduction to Mathematical Finance** by Fred Espen Benth.

The book provides a rigorous introduction to mathematical finance, focusing on option pricing theory through stochastic analysis. 

It is ideal for readers with a background in probability theory, stochastic processes, and differential equations who want to dive deeper into the mathematical foundations of financial derivatives.
